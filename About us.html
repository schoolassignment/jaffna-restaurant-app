  <h1> About us </h1>
    <p style="text-align:center;"> <strong>FOOD IS THE ELIXIR OF LIFE. IT BRINGS CELEBRATION, JOY AND TOGETHERNESS.
      ITS THE CENTRAL AXIS OF HUMAN LIFE.</strong></p><p>Many mistake all south-asian food as indian food. 
        Eventhough indian food is a large part of it, there is <strong>SO</strong> much more to the Sout-Asian kitchen. 
        We are here to bring you the best of northern Sri Lankan food. Of all the aspects of Jaffna, the most outstanding feature is the cuisine. 
      No restaurant would miss out on Jaffna chicken on its menu and its spicy sumptuous taste gratifies the Indian's and the foreigner's palette to a greater extent. 
      The popular, appetizing Jaffna dishes include pepper chicken and varuval. The speciality of the masala made by using sundried assortments pounded on pestles provides earthy flavour.
      The Jaffnars are known for their hospitality and the size of the kitchen and lavish banquet halls bear testimony to the feasts served there. 
      Being in a joint family system, every meal is prepared in a large quantity and an elaborate affair. 
      The utensils used are unique in the size and design and the Chettinad history of hosting the British guest during the 19th century bears proof for using western dishes and usage of cutlery. 
      Still, the age-old tradition of serving traditional multicourse meal of 20 dishes, is the integral part of the cuisine.</p>
